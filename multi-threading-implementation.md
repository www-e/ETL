# Multi-threading Implementation in ETL Pipeline

## Overview

This document explains how multi-threading is implemented in our ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline to improve performance and scalability. The multi-threading approach allows the application to process large datasets more efficiently by distributing the workload across multiple threads.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Spring Batch Chunk Processing

The core of our multi-threading implementation is based on Spring Batch's chunk processing model. In this model:

- Data is read, processed, and written in chunks (configurable batch sizes)
- Each chunk can be processed in parallel
- Transaction boundaries are maintained at the chunk level

### 2. Advanced TaskExecutor Configuration

The multi-threading capability is implemented in `BatchConfig.java` through an advanced `TaskExecutor` bean:

```java
@Bean
public TaskExecutor taskExecutor() {
    ThreadPoolTaskExecutor taskExecutor = new ThreadPoolTaskExecutor();
    taskExecutor.setCorePoolSize(maxThreads);
    taskExecutor.setMaxPoolSize(maxThreads * 2);
    taskExecutor.setQueueCapacity(queueCapacity);
    taskExecutor.setThreadNamePrefix("etl-thread-");
    taskExecutor.setAllowCoreThreadTimeOut(true);
    taskExecutor.setKeepAliveSeconds(60);
    taskExecutor.setWaitForTasksToCompleteOnShutdown(true);
    taskExecutor.initialize();
    return taskExecutor;
}
```

Key components:
- `ThreadPoolTaskExecutor`: A more advanced executor that maintains a pool of worker threads
- `setCorePoolSize`: Sets the base number of threads (configurable via application properties)
- `setMaxPoolSize`: Allows dynamic scaling up to handle peak loads
- `setQueueCapacity`: Controls how many tasks can be queued when all threads are busy
- `setAllowCoreThreadTimeOut`: Allows idle threads to be terminated to conserve resources
- Thread naming prefix ("etl-thread-"): Makes thread identification easier in logs and monitoring

### 3. Configuring Step for Parallel Processing

The task executor is applied to the ETL step in the `etlStep` method:

```java
@Bean
public Step etlStep() {
    return new StepBuilder("etlStep", jobRepository)
            .<InputData, ProcessedData>chunk(chunkSize, transactionManager)
            .reader(reader(null))
            .processor(processor())
            .writer(writer())
            .taskExecutor(taskExecutor())
            .build();
}
```

By adding the `taskExecutor()` to the step configuration, we enable parallel processing of chunks.

### 4. Configuration Properties

The multi-threading behavior is configurable through application properties:

```properties
# ETL Configuration
etl.chunk-size=100          # Number of items processed in each transaction
etl.max-threads=4           # Maximum number of concurrent threads
```

These properties can be adjusted based on:
- Available system resources (CPU cores, memory)
- Dataset characteristics
- Performance requirements

## How Multi-threading Works in the ETL Pipeline

1. **Reading**: The `reader` component reads items from the source (CSV, Excel, JSON) one at a time
2. **Chunking**: Items are collected into chunks of size defined by `etl.chunk-size`
3. **Parallel Processing**: Each chunk is processed in parallel by:
   - The `processor` component applies transformations
   - The `writer` component saves processed data to the database
4. **Thread Management**: The `SimpleAsyncTaskExecutor` manages thread creation and execution
5. **Concurrency Control**: The number of concurrent threads is limited by `etl.max-threads`

## Thread Safety Considerations

Our implementation ensures thread safety through:

1. **Stateless Components**: The processor is designed to be stateless, allowing safe parallel execution
2. **Transaction Boundaries**: Each chunk is processed within its own transaction
3. **Thread-Safe Collections**: Using thread-safe collections like `ConcurrentHashMap` for job tracking
4. **Database Isolation**: SQLite's transaction isolation prevents data corruption

## Performance Impact

The multi-threading implementation provides significant performance improvements:

- **Linear Scaling**: Processing time decreases almost linearly with the number of threads (up to a point)
- **Resource Utilization**: Better utilization of available CPU cores
- **Throughput Improvement**: Higher number of records processed per second

## Monitoring Thread Activity

Thread activity can be monitored through:

1. **Logging**: Thread names are prefixed with "etl-thread-" for easy identification in logs
2. **Step Execution Statistics**: Spring Batch provides detailed statistics for each step execution
3. **Job Status API**: The `/api/etl/status/{jobId}` endpoint returns detailed execution information

## Tuning Guidelines

For optimal performance:

1. **Chunk Size**: 
   - Larger chunks reduce transaction overhead but increase memory usage
   - Recommended starting point: 50-100 items per chunk

2. **Thread Count**:
   - General rule: Set to number of available CPU cores + 1
   - For I/O-bound operations, higher thread counts may be beneficial
   - For CPU-bound operations, match to available cores

3. **Memory Allocation**:
   - Ensure sufficient heap space for parallel processing
   - Monitor memory usage during processing

### 5. Thread-Safe Database Operations

To handle concurrent database operations, especially with SQLite which has limited concurrency support, we've implemented several improvements:

```java
public class DatabaseWriter implements ItemWriter<ProcessedData> {
    // Lock to synchronize database access
    private static final ReentrantLock dbLock = new ReentrantLock();
    
    // Retry configuration
    private static final int MAX_RETRIES = 5;
    private static final long RETRY_DELAY_MS = 200;
    
    @Override
    public void write(Chunk<? extends ProcessedData> items) throws Exception {
        // Acquire lock to prevent concurrent writes
        dbLock.lock();
        try {
            for (ProcessedData data : items) {
                writeWithRetry(data);
            }
        } finally {
            // Always release the lock
            dbLock.unlock();
        }
    }
    
    private void writeWithRetry(ProcessedData data) throws Exception {
        // Implementation with exponential backoff retry logic
    }
}
```

Key features:
- `ReentrantLock`: Ensures only one thread can write to the database at a time
- Retry logic with exponential backoff: Handles transient database locking issues
- Exception handling: Properly categorizes and handles different types of database errors

### 6. SQLite Concurrency Optimization

SQLite database connection is configured with parameters to improve concurrency:

```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:sqlite:etl_database.db?journal_mode=WAL&synchronous=NORMAL&busy_timeout=30000
spring.datasource.hikari.maximum-pool-size=10
spring.datasource.hikari.minimum-idle=5
spring.datasource.hikari.connection-timeout=30000
```

Key optimizations:
- WAL (Write-Ahead Logging): Allows concurrent reads during write operations
- Busy timeout: Waits for locks to be released instead of failing immediately
- Connection pool configuration: Manages database connections efficiently

### 7. Output File Organization

Processed files are organized by type in separate output directories:

```java
// Determine output directory based on file type
File typeOutputDir;
switch (fileExtension) {
    case "csv":
        typeOutputDir = csvOutputDir;
        break;
    case "json":
        typeOutputDir = jsonOutputDir;
        break;
    case "xls":
    case "xlsx":
        typeOutputDir = excelOutputDir;
        break;
    default:
        // Default to main output directory
        typeOutputDir = outputDirectory;
        break;
}
```

This organization improves file management and makes it easier to locate processed files by type.
