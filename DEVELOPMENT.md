# ETL Pipeline Development Guide

## Introduction
This document provides a simplified guide for developing an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using Spring Batch. The project demonstrates fundamental ETL concepts in a practical, educational context .
## Dataset
For this project, we will use a simple sales dataset in CSV format. This dataset is straightforward and educational, making it ideal for demonstrating ETL processes.

### Sales Dataset Structure
| Column Name      | Data Type | Description                              |
|------------------|-----------|------------------------------------------|
| transaction_id   | Integer   | Unique identifier for each transaction   |
| product_id       | Integer   | Identifier for the product               |
| product_name     | String    | Name of the product                      |
| category         | String    | Product category                         |
| quantity         | Integer   | Number of units sold                     |
| price_per_unit   | Double    | Price per unit in dollars                |
| total_amount     | Double    | Total transaction amount                 |
| transaction_date | Date      | Date when the transaction occurred       |
| customer_id      | Integer   | Identifier for the customer              |
| store_id         | Integer   | Identifier for the store location        |

### Sample Data Creation
Create a file named `sales_data.csv` in the `src/main/resources/data` directory with the following sample data (first 5 rows shown):

```
transaction_id,product_id,product_name,category,quantity,price_per_unit,total_amount,transaction_date,customer_id,store_id
1001,5001,Laptop XPS 15,Electronics,1,1299.99,1299.99,2024-01-15,10001,101
1002,5002,Wireless Mouse,Accessories,2,24.99,49.98,2024-01-15,10002,101
1003,5003,USB-C Cable,Accessories,3,9.99,29.97,2024-01-16,10003,102
1004,5001,Laptop XPS 15,Electronics,1,1299.99,1299.99,2024-01-16,10004,103
1005,5004,Headphones,Electronics,1,89.99,89.99,2024-01-17,10001,101
```

## Project Phases

### Phase 1 (Already Completed): Project Setup and Planning
1. **Understand Requirements**: Clearly define what the ETL pipeline needs to accomplish
2. **Set Up Environment**: Install and configure Java 21, Maven, SQLite, and IDE (Visual Studio Code)
3. **Project Structure**: Create the basic project structure using Spring Boot and Spring Batch using the spring initializr.
4. **Database Design**: Design the target SQLite database schema (we have already created the database in a csv format)
5. **Source Data Analysis**: Analyze the source CSV data format and structure

### Phase 2: Extract Process (The E in ETL)
1. **Reader Configuration**: Set up FlatFileItemReader to read the CSV data
2. **Data Validation**: Implement basic validation for the extracted data
3. **Error Handling**: Configure error handling for the extraction process

### Phase 3: Transform Process (The T in ETL)
1. **Data Transformation**: Implement transformations to convert source data to target format
2. **Data Enrichment**: Add calculated fields or additional information
3. **Data Filtering**: Filter out unnecessary or invalid data (e.g., missing values, invalid formats which is called the preprocessing step)
4. **Data Validation**: Validate the transformed data

### Phase 4: Load Process (The L in ETL)
1. **Writer Configuration**: Set up JdbcBatchItemWriter to write to SQLite
2. **Batch Processing**: Configure appropriate batch sizes
3. **Transaction Management**: Implement proper transaction handling

### Phase 5: Multi-threading Implementation
1. **Parallelization Strategy**: Decide on appropriate multi-threading approach
2. **Thread Pool Configuration**: Configure thread pools and execution parameters
3. **Performance Tuning**: Balance resource usage and processing speed

### Phase 6: Testing and Validation
1. **Unit Testing**: Test individual components
2. **Integration Testing**: Test the entire pipeline
3. **Performance Testing**: Verify the performance meets requirements

## Educational Concepts

### ETL Fundamentals
- **Extract**: Reading data from a source system (CSV files in our case)
- **Transform**: Converting, enriching, and validating the data
- **Load**: Writing the transformed data to a target system (SQLite database)

### Spring Batch Core Concepts
- **Job**: The complete ETL process (a job consists of one or more steps)
- **Step**: A discrete unit of work within a job (e.g., reading, processing, writing)
- **Chunk-oriented Processing**: Processing a set number of items as a single transaction
- **Reader-Processor-Writer Pattern**: The standard pattern for data processing in Spring Batch

### Multi-threading in ETL
- **Benefits**: Improved throughput and resource utilization
- **Challenges**: Thread safety, resource contention, transaction management
- **Implementation Options**: Multi-threaded steps, partitioning, parallel steps

### SQLite Usage in ETL
- **Advantages**: Lightweight, serverless, zero-configuration
- **Limitations**: Concurrency constraints, performance considerations
- **Best Practices**: Proper indexing, transaction management, batch processing

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Setting Up Project Structure
Create the following directories:
- `src/main/java/com/etl/config` - For configuration classes
- `src/main/java/com/etl/model` - For data model classes
- `src/main/java/com/etl/processor` - For data processors
- `src/main/java/com/etl/reader` - For data readers
- `src/main/java/com/etl/writer` - For data writers
- `src/main/resources/data` - For source data files
- `src/main/resources/schema` - For database schema files

### 2. Creating Data Models
Define Java classes to represent:
- Source data (CSV records)
- Transformed data (processed records)
- Target data (database records)

### 3. Implementing the ETL Pipeline
- Configure Spring Batch job, steps, and components
- Implement CSV reader for data extraction
- Create processors for data transformation
- Set up JDBC writer for data loading
- Configure multi-threading for improved performance

### 4. Running and Monitoring the ETL Process
- Execute the ETL job
- Monitor the process using Spring Batch's built-in metrics
- Validate the results in the target database

## Questions to Consider

### Design Questions
1. What transformations should be applied to the sales data?
2. How should we handle data quality issues (missing values, invalid formats)?
3. What indexes should be created in the target database for optimal query performance?

### Implementation Questions
1. What is the appropriate chunk size for processing the sales data?
2. How many threads should be used for parallel processing?
3. How should we handle and log errors during the ETL process?

### Testing Questions
1. How can we verify the correctness of the transformed data?
2. What performance metrics should we measure?
3. How can we test the error handling mechanisms?

## Expected Outcomes
Upon completion of this project, students will have:
1. A functional ETL pipeline that processes sales data
2. A deeper understanding of Spring Batch and ETL concepts
3. Experience with multi-threaded processing
4. Practical skills in data transformation and loading

## Conclusion
This project provides a practical introduction to ETL processes using Spring Batch. By working with realistic sales data and implementing a complete extract-transform-load pipeline, students will gain valuable experience in data processing that can be applied to more complex scenarios in the future.
