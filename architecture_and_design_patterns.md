# ETL Application Architecture and Design Patterns

## Overview

The ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) application is a robust data processing system built with Spring Boot and Spring Batch. It is designed to process data from various file formats (CSV, Excel, JSON), transform the data through a series of operations, and load it into a SQLite database. The application also provides a web interface for monitoring and managing the ETL processes.

## Architectural Patterns

### 1. Layered Architecture

The application follows a classic layered architecture pattern:

- **Presentation Layer**: Controllers that handle HTTP requests and responses
- **Service Layer**: Services that orchestrate business operations
- **Data Access Layer**: Readers and writers that interact with files and databases
- **Domain Layer**: Models that represent the core business entities

This separation of concerns enhances maintainability and testability of the application.

### 2. Batch Processing Architecture

The core of the application is built on Spring Batch, which provides a robust framework for batch processing. The batch processing architecture includes:

- **Job**: The top-level entity representing a complete batch process
- **Step**: A phase in a job that represents a specific operation
- **ItemReader**: Reads data from a source (CSV, Excel, JSON files)
- **ItemProcessor**: Processes the data (validates, transforms, calculates)
- **ItemWriter**: Writes the processed data to a destination (SQLite database)

### 3. MVC Architecture

For the web interface, the application follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern:

- **Model**: Domain objects like `InputData` and `ProcessedData`
- **View**: Thymeleaf templates for rendering HTML
- **Controller**: Classes like `WebController`, `EtlController`, etc., that handle user requests

### 4. Asynchronous Processing Architecture

The application employs asynchronous processing to handle long-running ETL jobs without blocking the user interface:

- **Async Service Methods**: Methods annotated with `@Async` to run in separate threads
- **Job Execution Tracking**: Mechanisms to track and report job status asynchronously

## Design Patterns

### 1. Factory Pattern

The application uses the Factory pattern to create appropriate readers based on file types:

- `FileReaderFactory`: Creates readers for different file formats (CSV, Excel, JSON)
- Each reader implementation (CsvReader, ExcelReader, JsonReader) encapsulates the logic for reading a specific file format

### 2. Builder Pattern

The application uses the Builder pattern (via Lombok's `@Builder` annotation) for creating complex objects:

- `InputData.builder()`: Creates InputData objects with many optional fields
- `ProcessedData.builder()`: Creates ProcessedData objects with many optional fields

### 3. Dependency Injection

Spring's dependency injection is used throughout the application:

- `@Autowired` annotations for injecting dependencies
- Configuration classes that define beans to be injected

### 4. Strategy Pattern

The application uses the Strategy pattern for different processing strategies:

- Different reader implementations (CsvReader, ExcelReader, JsonReader) provide different strategies for reading data
- The DataProcessor uses different validation and calculation strategies based on the data

### 5. Template Method Pattern

The Spring Batch framework uses the Template Method pattern:

- `ItemReader`, `ItemProcessor`, and `ItemWriter` interfaces define the template methods
- Concrete implementations provide the specific behavior

### 6. Singleton Pattern

Spring beans are singletons by default, and the application leverages this pattern:

- Configuration classes are singletons
- Service classes are singletons
- Repositories are singletons

### 7. Repository Pattern

The application uses the Repository pattern for data access:

- `DatabaseWriter` encapsulates the data access logic
- JDBC operations are abstracted away from the business logic

### 8. Decorator Pattern

The application uses the Decorator pattern to add behavior to objects:

- `FlatFileItemReader` is decorated with line mappers and tokenizers
- Transaction management decorates database operations

### 9. Command Pattern

The application uses the Command pattern for job execution:

- Job parameters encapsulate the command to execute
- JobLauncher executes the command

## Concurrency and Synchronization

### 1. Thread Pool Management

The application manages concurrency through a thread pool:

```java
@Bean
public TaskExecutor taskExecutor() {
    org.springframework.scheduling.concurrent.ThreadPoolTaskExecutor taskExecutor = 
        new org.springframework.scheduling.concurrent.ThreadPoolTaskExecutor();
    
    taskExecutor.setCorePoolSize(maxThreads);
    taskExecutor.setMaxPoolSize(maxThreads);
    taskExecutor.setQueueCapacity(queueCapacity);
    taskExecutor.setThreadNamePrefix("etl-thread-");
    taskExecutor.setAllowCoreThreadTimeOut(true);
    taskExecutor.setKeepAliveSeconds(120);
    taskExecutor.setWaitForTasksToCompleteOnShutdown(true);
    taskExecutor.setAwaitTerminationSeconds(60);
    taskExecutor.initialize();
    
    return taskExecutor;
}
```

### 2. Lock-Based Synchronization

The application uses locks to synchronize database access:

```java
// Lock to synchronize database writes
private static final ReentrantLock dbLock = new ReentrantLock();

// Try to acquire lock with timeout to prevent deadlocks
boolean lockAcquired = false;
try {
    lockAcquired = dbLock.tryLock(effectiveLockTimeout, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
    // ... perform database operations
} finally {
    if (lockAcquired) {
        dbLock.unlock();
    }
}
```

### 3. Transaction Management

The application uses a custom transaction manager for SQLite to handle database transactions:

- `SQLiteTransactionManager`: Manages database transactions with special handling for SQLite's limitations
- Prioritizes job repository operations over data operations to prevent deadlocks

## Error Handling and Resilience

### 1. Retry Mechanism

The application implements a sophisticated retry mechanism for handling transient database errors:

```java
private void writeBatchWithRetry(Chunk<? extends ProcessedData> items) throws Exception {
    Exception lastException = null;
    boolean success = false;
    
    for (int attempt = 1; attempt <= maxRetries && !success; attempt++) {
        try {
            // ... database operations
            success = true;
        } catch (Exception e) {
            lastException = e;
            long delay = calculateBackoffDelay(attempt);
            log.warn("Attempt {} failed, retrying in {}ms: {}", attempt, delay, e.getMessage());
            Thread.sleep(delay);
        }
    }
    
    if (!success) {
        throw lastException;
    }
}
```

### 2. Exponential Backoff

The application uses exponential backoff for retries:

```java
private long calculateBackoffDelay(int attempt) {
    double exponentialFactor = Math.pow(backoffMultiplier, attempt - 1);
    long delay = (long) (initialRetryDelayMs * exponentialFactor);
    
    // Add some randomness (jitter) to prevent synchronized retries
    delay += (long) (delay * 0.2 * Math.random());
    
    // Cap at max delay
    return Math.min(delay, maxRetryDelayMs);
}
```

### 3. Validation and Error Reporting

The application validates input data and reports errors:

```java
private boolean validateData(InputData data, List<String> validationMessages) {
    boolean isValid = true;
    
    // Check for null or empty required fields
    if (data.getId() == null || data.getId().trim().isEmpty()) {
        validationMessages.add("ID is required");
        isValid = false;
    }
    
    // ... more validation
    
    return isValid;
}
```

## Extensibility and Configurability

### 1. Configurable Parameters

The application uses Spring's `@Value` annotation to make parameters configurable:

```java
@Value("${etl.chunk-size:10}")
private int chunkSize;

@Value("${etl.max-threads:4}")
private int maxThreads;

@Value("${etl.throttle-limit:4}")
private int throttleLimit;

@Value("${etl.queue-capacity:16}")
private int queueCapacity;
```

### 2. Pluggable Components

The application is designed with pluggable components:

- New file formats can be added by implementing a new reader
- New data transformations can be added to the processor
- New output formats can be added to the writer

## Conclusion

The ETL application demonstrates a well-architected system that leverages multiple design patterns and architectural patterns to create a robust, scalable, and maintainable solution. The use of Spring Boot and Spring Batch provides a solid foundation, while custom implementations address specific requirements and challenges.
